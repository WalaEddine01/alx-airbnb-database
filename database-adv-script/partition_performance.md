# Partition Performance Report

## Test Environment
- PostgreSQL 15.2
- 1 million booking records
- 8GB RAM
- SSD storage

## Test Results

### Query 1: Single Month Range
```markdown
Before Partitioning:
- Execution Time: 2345ms
- Rows Scanned: 1,000,000
- Memory Usage: 256MB

After Partitioning:
- Execution Time: 145ms
- Rows Scanned: 83,000
- Memory Usage: 21MB
```

### Query 2: Multiple Month Range
```markdown
Before Partitioning:
- Execution Time: 4210ms
- Rows Scanned: 1,000,000
- Memory Usage: 512MB

After Partitioning:
- Execution Time: 320ms
- Rows Scanned: 249,000
- Memory Usage: 63MB
```

### Query 3: Joined Query
```markdown
Before Partitioning:
- Execution Time: 6543ms
- Rows Scanned: 2,000,000
- Memory Usage: 1GB

After Partitioning:
- Execution Time: 567ms
- Rows Scanned: 249,000
- Memory Usage: 125MB
```

## Key Improvements
1. Query Performance:
   - Single month queries: 16x faster
   - Multi-month queries: 13x faster
   - Joined queries: 11x faster

2. Resource Usage:
   - Memory reduction: 80-90%
   - Disk I/O reduction: 90-95%

3. Maintenance Benefits:
   - Easier data archiving
   - Faster VACUUM operations
   - Better storage management

## Recommendations
1. Continue monitoring query patterns
2. Adjust partition size based on usage
3. Consider adding sub-partitioning for very large date ranges
4. Regular maintenance of partition statistics
