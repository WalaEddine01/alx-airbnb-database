# üìä Airbnb SQL Optimization Project

## üèóÔ∏è About the Project

This project is part of the **ALX Airbnb Database Module**, focused on building advanced skills in SQL querying, database optimization, and performance tuning. You will work with a simulated Airbnb database and apply real-world techniques such as indexing, query refactoring, and table partitioning to improve query efficiency and manage large-scale data systems.

By tackling realistic challenges, you‚Äôll gain practical experience that prepares you for high-performance applications in the real world ‚Äî where scalability and speed matter.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

This project is designed to strengthen the database skills of professional developers. By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- ‚úÖ **Master Advanced SQL**: Write complex queries with joins, subqueries, aggregations, and window functions.
- üöÄ **Optimize Query Performance**: Use tools like `EXPLAIN`, `ANALYZE`, and `SHOW PROFILE` to analyze and refactor inefficient queries.
- üß† **Implement Indexing & Partitioning**: Apply indexing and partitioning strategies to optimize large datasets.
- üìà **Monitor & Refine Performance**: Continuously track query performance and improve schema and queries accordingly.
- üß© **Think Like a DBA**: Make informed, performance-driven decisions in schema design and optimization.

## ‚úÖ Requirements

To complete this project successfully, you should have:

- Solid knowledge of SQL fundamentals (`SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, etc.)
- Understanding of relational database concepts (primary/foreign keys, normalization)
- Familiarity with query performance tools like `EXPLAIN`, `ANALYZE`, and `SHOW PROFILE`
- Ability to manage and submit your work using a GitHub repository

## üåü Key Highlights

### 1. Defining Relationships with ER Diagrams
Model relationships between key entities such as **users**, **properties**, **bookings**, and **reviews** using ER diagrams.

### 2. Complex Queries with Joins
Write efficient SQL queries using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` to extract meaningful insights across multiple tables.

### 3. Power of Subqueries
Work with both correlated and non-correlated subqueries to perform advanced filtering and analytics like computing user activity levels or average property ratings.

### 4. Aggregations & Window Functions
Use aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`) and window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, etc.) to analyze patterns and trends in the Airbnb dataset.

### 5. Indexing for Optimization
Create indexes on high-usage columns to improve lookup speed and query efficiency. Measure performance improvements through execution plans.

### 6. Query Optimization Techniques
Apply techniques like query refactoring, minimizing wildcards, and limiting results. Use `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE` to guide refactoring decisions.

### 7. Partitioning Large Tables
Partition large tables (e.g., the `booking` table) by date ranges to enhance performance on time-based queries. Compare before-and-after performance using metrics.

### 8. Performance Monitoring & Schema Refinement
Use tools to monitor query performance and propose schema changes (e.g., normalization adjustments, index redesigns). Document and validate your optimizations with real metrics.
